Movie recommendation  System with Machine Learning

-Overview of the code Implementation
This Movie Recommendation System is basically a machine learning-based solution designed to offer personalized movie suggestions to users. It incorporates advanced techniques in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and ensemble learning algorithms to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of movie recommendations.

Features
1. Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Robust techniques have been implemented to handle missing values in the dataset, ensuring a clean and complete dataset for analysis.

Categorical Feature Conversion: Categorical features are appropriately converted to numerical representations, facilitating the application of machine learning algorithms.

2. Feature Engineering
Creation of 'genres_bin': A new feature 'genres_bin' is introduced, providing a binarized representation of movie genres. This enhances the model's ability to capture genre-specific preferences.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Enhanced Visualizations: Comprehensive visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, pie charts, box plots, and heatmaps, offer deeper insights into the distribution and relationships among different features.
4. Feature Selection
SelectKBest Algorithm: The SelectKBest algorithm is employed for feature selection, focusing on the most relevant features for improved model efficiency.
